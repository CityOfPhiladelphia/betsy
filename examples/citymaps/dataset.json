For building permits that require special system certifications for fire alarms and fire suppression, the acquisition of these certifications is noted on the permit. \n\nPermit, license, inspection, case and violation data from the Department of Licenses & Inspections. Documentation available at http://phlapi.com/licenseapi.html A permit grants legal permission to commence work on physical changes or zoning changes to a lot or structure. These include but are not limited to new constructions, alterations, demolitions, occupancy changes, and installations of and modifications to electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems. Each permit has a unique Permit Number. The Application Type Description (and the abbreviated ApplicationType) indicates the general nature of the permit application (for example: whether the permit is for new construction or mechanical work). The Permit Code Description is more specific and describes in detail the objectives of the permitted work. For example, in the case of mechanical work, a Code Description may specify the type and number of appliances to be installed (MEC-EQUIPMENT/APPLIANCE INSTAL). There is then a Description of Work for each specific permit to summarize the intent of the work. The Status and Last Modified Date indicate the current standing of the project.

Specificity of land use increases with each increasing digit. Coded numeric values are stored as integers. Full text descriptions are contained in separate string fields. Values in the 3-digit code and description fields may not be fully populated, indicating that these features have not been field verified, or that this level of specificity cannot be accurately assigned. All features are attributed at the 1- and 2-digit levels.\n\nKey Attribute Fields\nc_Dig1 - 1-digit level land use coding, numeric code.\nc_Dig2 - 2-digit level land use coding, numeric code.\n\n1.0 Residential \n1.1 Residential Low Density\n1.2 Residential Medium Density\n1.3 Residential High Density\n2.0 Commercial\n2.1 Commercial Consumer\n2.2 Commercial Business and Professional\n2.3 Commercial Mixed Residential \n3.0 Industrial \n4.0 Civic/Institution\n5.0 Transportation\n6.0 Culture/Recreation\n6.1 Culture/Amusement\n6.2 Active Recreation\n7.0 Park/Open Space\n7.1 Park/Open Space\n7.2 Cemetery\n8.0 Water\n9.0Vacant or Other\n9.1 Vacant Land\n9.2 Other/Unknown\n\nc_Dig3 - 3-digit level land use coding, numeric code.\nc_Dig1Desc - 1-digit level land use text description.\nc_Dig2Desc - 2-digit level land use text description.\nc_Dig3Desc - 3-digit level land use text description.\nYEAR - the year to which the land use codes are current. If year 2010, this reflects land use codes that have NOT been field surveyed and the codes were assigned as described in the \"Development Process\" below.\nSouth (2014)\nWest Park (2011) \nUniversity Southwest (2012) \n\nField checks and updates are planned for the 11 remaining Planning Districts as part of the Philadelpia2035 comprehensive planning process.\n\nCitywide land use as determined by the City Philadelphia Planning Commission (PCPC). Prepared for Philadelphia2035, the City\u2019s comprehensive development plan, to support the zoning reform remapping and the District Planning projects. For more information on the Philadelphia2035 comprehensive planning process, see www.phila2035.org \nLand use classifications are activity-based. Each land unit has only one land use designation interpreted by a 1, 2 or 3-digit code. Specificity of a land use description increases from the one to three digit code. Example: 1= Residential, 1.2 = Residential Medium Density, and 1.2.1 = Residential Rowhouse.\nLand use features are derived from Philadelphia Water Department tax parcel boundaries (2009 to current release date) and from other GIS datasets prepared by City departments including: planimetric features, transportation right-of-ways (ROW), parks and open space, and water. Land use boundaries are typically coincident with PWD tax parcel boundaries, where tax parcel boundaries are available to define units of land. In some cases multiple land activities on a single parcel and been individual represented as individual polygons of land use. \nThis land use feature class is under revision through 2014. Updates will be made to correct attributes and features and to populate 3-digit codes based upon field verifications made by PCPC staff. Land use field surveys will be conducted for each of the 18 Planning District beginning in 2011 as part of the Philadelphia2035 Compressive Planning process. For areas not yet updated by a Planning District field survey, land use designations are qualified estimates derived from the Office of Property Assessment data (see details under \u201cDevelopment Process\u201d below).

Cluster analysis does this by forming groups of areas that are similar along a set of selected values that describe those areas. While the groups are formed to be as uniform as possible within, the groups are also as dissimilar as possible from one another. Using this technique, the MVA is able to reduce vast amounts of data on hundreds of thousands of properties and hundreds of areas down to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources. Reinvestment Fund uses many indicators in its analyses including various combinations of the following: average home sale price, percent change in average home sale price over time, percent owner occupancy, percent vacancy, percent vacant lots, percent of rental units that are Section 8, percent commercial, percent of properties with foreclosure, percent prime home purchase loans, number of new construction permits, number of Sheriff sales as a percent of owner occupied units, number of public housing units, percent of properties deemed dangerous, percent of structures demolished, percent of high risk or very high risk credit scores for predatory lending, and percent of housing units built before 1950.<br /><br />Working with the MVA client, Reinvestment Fund forms geographic study areas for the cluster analysis. Although many of these study areas are displayed using similar color schemes, they can not be compared.

Cluster analysis does this by forming groups of areas that are similar along a set of selected values that describe those areas. While the groups are formed to be as uniform as possible within, the groups are also as dissimilar as possible from one another. Using this technique, the MVA is able to reduce vast amounts of data on hundreds of thousands of properties and hundreds of areas down to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.
