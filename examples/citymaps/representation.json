The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.<br /><br />Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.<br /><br />Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.<br /><br />Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity.

Select fields utilize geodatabase domains to populate cells with full text descriptions. Use of the layer outside of the Esri geodatabase will result in the appearance of one to three digit codes instead of full text descriptions in the following fields: Asset_Group1, Asset_Group2, Asset_Type, Asset_Subtype1, Asset_Subtype2, CityUse_Desc, Serving_Type, and Status.<br /><br />Each record is attributed with a sequential, numeric identification number (Asset_ID). <br /><br />Every building has only one Asset_ID, except in cases where distinct operations required separate tracking and identification. These instances include Police, Fire, Judiciary/District Attorney, garages and Street\u2019s highway facilities, and Older Adult Centers. Where facilities share a building, each facility is assigned its own Asset_ID and Asset_Subtype values.

A combination of automated feature extraction (Planimetrics), desktop digitization and field survey is the basis for this dataset which is updated regularly by PWD. As new orthoimagery reveals changes in stream geometry, adjustments are made to the polygon and line file to reflect reality. The resolution and accuracy of newer orthoimagery improve over time, allowing more detailed feature extraction.\nOffice of Watersheds staff maintains the feature datasets regularly, making geometric and attribute changes or adding new streams or infrastructure. The database is setup to reflect various forms of infrastructure along streams such as culverts, bridges, dams, and channelized segments. Additionally, unique segment and reach IDs were added to correlate to PWD Fluvial Geomorphology stream studies. USGS NHD Stream Names and IDs have been carried over and stream order classifications using both the Shreve and Strahler methods are coded.

At the time of capture ground condiitons were leaf-off, snow free, and water was at normal levels. <br />", "field_266_raw": "Public", "field_190": "", "field_24": "2", "field_184": "", "field_198_raw": "GeoDB2", "field_24_raw": 2, "field_11_raw": [{"identifier": "LiDAR and LAS Data", "id": "5543864520583086178c4e76"}], "field_52_raw": "Archive", "field_166": "", "field_57_raw": "04/18/2015 to 04/25/2015 ", "field_199_raw": "Access DB", "field_258": "05/26/2017", "field_216_raw": 0, "field_202_raw": "", "field_200_raw": false, "field_216": "0", "field_187_raw": [], "field_54_raw": ""}, {"field_54": "Awaiting Authorization", "field_49_raw": "NAD_1983_StatePlane_Pennsylvania_South_FIPS_3702_Feet", "field_183": "", "field_57": "1930-Current", "field_50": "", "field_51": "", "field_52": "Continuously", "field_11": "<span class=\"55e9a66a18af3c363f8733df\">PLCB Liquor Licenses</span>", "field_199": "SDE Geodatabase", "field_8_raw": "Data received from PLCB on July 16, 2015, geocoded by GIS Services Group.", "field_269_raw": "Liquor Licenses", "id": "563cc91d7b4dd09a0fb886da", "field_7_raw": "Liquor Licenses", "field_187": "", "field_269": "Liquor Licenses", "field_190_raw": "GIS_LNI.PLCB_LIQUOR_LICENSES", "field_266": "", "field_260": "", "field_9_raw": "", "field_201_raw": "", "field_8": "Data received from PLCB on July 16, 2015, geocoded by GIS Services Group.", "field_9": "", "field_202": "07/16/2015", "field_7": "Liquor Licenses", "field_200": "No", "field_50_raw": "", "field_47_raw": "An inventory of all currently active and and safekeeping liquor licenses within the boundaries of the City of Philadelphia.", "field_198": "GeoDB2", "field_182": "", "field_49": "NAD_1983_StatePlane_Pennsylvania_South_FIPS_3702_Feet", "field_47": "An inventory of all currently active and and safekeeping liquor licenses within the boundaries of the City of Philadelphia.", "field_190": "GIS_LNI.PLCB_LIQUOR_LICENSES", "field_24": "6", "field_51_raw": "", "field_184": "", "field_198_raw": "GeoDB2", "field_24_raw": 6, "field_11_raw": [{"identifier": "PLCB Liquor Licenses", "id": "55e9a66a18af3c363f8733df"}], "field_52_raw": "Continuously", "field_166_raw": "", "field_201": "", "field_166": "", "field_57_raw": "1930-Current", "field_199_raw": "SDE Geodatabase", "field_258": "", "field_216_raw": 0, "field_202_raw": {"am_pm": "AM", "timestamp": "07/16/2015 12:00 am", "hours": "12", "time": 720, "date": "07/16/2015", "unix_timestamp": 1437004800000, "date_formatted": "07/16/2015", "minutes": "00"}, "field_200_raw": false, "field_216": "0", "field_187_raw": [], "field_54_raw": "Awaiting Authorization"}, {"field_54": "Released", "field_49_raw": "GCS_WGS_1984", "field_183": "2", "field_57": "Current", "field_50": "The field SCORE can be used for labels and thematic display", "field_51": "", "field_52": "Semi-annually", "field_11": "<span class=\"555f812bf15fcb6c6ed44110\">Litter Index</span>", "field_199": "SDE Geodatabase", "field_8_raw": "Originally created in 2007, the Litter Index is used to compare the relative cleanliness of different areas of the city.

Cluster analysis does this by forming groups of areas that are similar along a set of selected values that describe those areas. While the groups are formed to be as uniform as possible within, the groups are also as dissimilar as possible from one another. Using this technique, the MVA is able to reduce vast amounts of data on hundreds of thousands of properties and hundreds of areas down to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources. Reinvestment Fund uses many indicators in its analyses including various combinations of the following: average home sale price, percent change in average home sale price over time, percent owner occupancy, percent vacancy, percent vacant lots, percent of rental units that are Section 8, percent commercial, percent of properties with foreclosure, percent prime home purchase loans, number of new construction permits, number of Sheriff sales as a percent of owner occupied units, number of public housing units, percent of properties deemed dangerous, percent of structures demolished, percent of high risk or very high risk credit scores for predatory lending, and percent of housing units built before 1950.<br /><br />Working with the MVA client, Reinvestment Fund forms geographic study areas for the cluster analysis.
